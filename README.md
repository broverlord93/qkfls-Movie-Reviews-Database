# Movies Review Database

Part of a series of courses on Coursera taught by IBM Skills Network.

It's a simple web app to store movie information in a database using IBM's cloud storage.

While the code was functional when it was written, the IBM cloud storage service has since been deactivated in order to use it in other projects.
This code is not being updated.
